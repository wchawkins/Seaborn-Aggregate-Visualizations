# **Seaborn Aggregate Visualizations**
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my ability to perform aggregate
data visualizations using Python's Seaborn library. All data was ethically
sourced from kaggle.com. The data is from a micro finance company called Kiva.
I decided to use aggregate visualizations to examine the equity of their lending
practices.

## Bar Chart: Mean Investment Amount by Country
* El Salvador and Cambodia receive significantly larger lone sums
* It is important to remember that the data are in units of USD and are not
normalized for individual countries currency value
* Cambodia has a much larger standard deviation in loan amount. That should
be analyzed to see if variance is caused by gender, religion, economic class or
other inappropriate reasons
